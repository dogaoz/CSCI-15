Compare two char data types:  ch1 = H  ch2 = B
absolute value of ch1: H
absolute value of ch2: BB is smaller of the two chars
H is bigger of the two chars
NOW! lets add a third char to the mix!
ch3 = a which has an absolute value of aB is the smallest among the three data types
a is the biggest among the three data types

Compare two int data types: num1 = 28  num2 = 33
absolute value of num1: 28
absolute value of num2: 3328 is smaller of the two ints
33 is bigger of the two ints
NOW! lets add a third int to the mix!num3 = -2 which has an absolute value of 2
-2 is the smallest among the three data types
33 is the biggest among the three data types
Compare two double data types:  d1 = 2.2  d2 = -1.1
absolute value of d1: 2.2
absolute value of d2: 1.1
-1.1 is smaller of the two doubles
2.2 is bigger of the two doublesNOW! lets add a third double to the mix!
d3 = 5.2 which has an absolute value of 5.2
-1.1 is the smallest among the three data types
5.2 is the biggest among the three data types
